ENTRANCE
You just entered into a house.
Looking around you see that the entrance is a safe and clean well-lighted place.

There looks to be a room to your "east".
And there is set of stairs to the "north".

ROOM ON FIRST FLOOR
Entering the room to the left you find it is just a wash room. 
Nothing exciting or new to discover here.  You can only go "back" to the entrance of the 
house from here.

SECOND FLOOR ENTRANCE
After climbing the stairs to the second floor, the house opens up into three areas.
There is a kitchen with, as you would expect, a table, chairs, refrigerator, 
and appliances. There is another set of stairs leading up a dark hallway.
You also see a den and living room. You may go "west" into the kitchen, 
"east" up the stairway, "north" into the den and living room, or "back" to the
entrance.

3RD FLOOR HALLWAY
Upon reaching the 3rd floor, you can barely see four doors in the dimly lit area.
After trying all doors only one appears to be unlocked. You also hear a noise behind
the same door.  You can "open" the door to the room with the noise or go "back" to the
second floor.

KITCHEN
There is a table surrounded by chairs.  There is no food on the table.  In addition
there are dishes drying in a drainer next to a fairly clean sink.
After looking around you see the refrigerator, several cabinets, and a plastic bottle 
containing a greenish brown liquid.  You can open the "refrigerator", "cabinets", drink from
the "bottle", or go "back".

DEN AND LIVING ROOM
The den and living room are rather large and separated by a wooden divider.  In the den there
is a table surrounded by three chairs and a oriental style wooden cabitnet. There is nothing of 
interest on the table. The living room is bare with exception to a sofa, couch, loveseat, coffee 
table, and a flat screen TV. Off to one side you see another dark stairwell leading down into the 
ground level of the house.  You can open the "cabinet" in the den, take the "stairway" to the 
ground floor, or go "back".

KITCHEN CABINETS
After rummaging around through the cabinets you are bitten by several Maricopa harvester ants. Due to
already being fatigued and famished you faint hitting your head on the counter as you fall to the 
floor.

You have died.

BOTTLE OF GREENISH BROWN LIQUID
You remove the cap of the bottle and smell tea. You shotgun a few mouthfuls and discover that it is
unsweetened organic green tea. The caffine makes you feel more alert and your thirst has been quinched.
You may "drink" more or go "back".

NOISY ROOM ON THIRD FLOOR
You open the door as you walk in, realize the noise was a person snooring, passed out on a queen sized bed.
The room is furnished but any attempt to inspect the room will likely wake the person.  You can "wake" the 
sleeping person or go "back" to the third floor hallway.

DEN CABINET
You open the cabinet and see a stack of what appears to be medical and legal paperwork for a person by the 
name of Amanda Zotter. After reading through some of the paperwork you find that she is a convicted felon, 
found guilty of a double homicde in which the accused lured people into her house and killed them with booby 
traps and poisoned food.  She has also been diagnosed with a multiple personality disorder one being 
violent, the other philanthropic and sacrificing for the needs of others. Inside the cabinet there is also 
an empty bottle of perscription medicine with Amanda's name on it and a label stating, "must be taken everyday 
or MPD relapse may occur!".  

You can continue to search the house by going "back" to the den and living room, or play it safe and
just "exit" the house.

STAIRWAY TO GROUND FLOOR
Because the stairway is dark you are not able to see the large whole in the stairs causing you to fall and 
break your leg.  The noise of your fall makes a lady by the name of Amanda Zotter come down to see what 
happened. She sees that your leg is broken, but before she attempts to help she asks you one question, "Did 
you read any of the paperwork in the cabinet in the den?" You can answer "yes", "no", or remain "silent".

BEER
After sniffing the can you only smell beer. You gulp down the less than half can of beer not knowing it contained 
cyanide.  As you slump to the floor and start to lose consciousness you notice marker handwritten on the side of the
can stating,"Revenge is a dish best served cold, neglect a lady, and i'll neglect your soul:)"

You have died.

You awaken the person on the bed, only to startle a lady by the name of Amanda Zotter. After realizing you are an

NO, GROUND FLOOR
Amanda feels compassion for you by putting a splint on your leg and moving you to one of her vacant bedrooms on the third 
floor.  She decides not call the police or paramedic for fear of you being taken to jail.  She claims she is a registered 
nurse and that she can take care of you. Consequently because Amanda's not taking her medication she eventually becomes her 
"other" personality.  She drugs you and you wake up restrained with a straight jacket on.  She has decied she will torture 
you by cutting parts of your body off until you admit to reading her paperwork in the cabinet.

There is no escaping.  Type "quit" to die.

PUNISHMENT FOR SILENCE
She pulls out a knife and says, "well there is only one way to cure silence", and she proceeds to cut you until you answer.
Unfortunately, due to blood loss you hemorrhage, pass out, and die.

TEA FOR A FINAL REWARD
You go down to the kitchen with Amanda and she pulls out a glass from one of the cabinets and pours a greenish brown liquid, she 
says calls organic green tea, into the glass. You drink, feel refreshed and she shows you the door. On your way out she says, "
next time you are in this area, stop by and I should have some Blue Moon for you to drink."

You won the game! Congratulations.
